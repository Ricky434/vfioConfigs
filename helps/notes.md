# Make vfio take over the nvidia gpu before nvidia drivers
1. Add vfio modules in mkinitcpio before nvidia as wiki says
2. Set ids of gpu that will be claimed by vfio in modprobe.d/vfio.conf
3. Rebuild initramfs

No need to blacklist nvidia modules in bootloader

# Boot with gpu not binded by vfio
1. Create new mkinitcpioNoVfio.conf
2. Add it to the linux.preset
3. Add a bootloader option with the initramfs generated by the new mkinitcpio.conf

# Random crashes
- msi afterburner could cause random vm reboots
- sometimes vm crashes and pc gets stuck with some cpu cores at 100%.
    - I tried using patched gpu rom, let's see if that works -> Didn't work
    - cs2 seems to be causing it relatively often
    - It probably is the PSU -> https://forums.unraid.net/topic/135752-going-crazy-trying-to-figure-out-gpu-passthrough-stability-issues/

Update: It WAS the PSU. It probably wasn't able to reliably and consistently deliver the watts required.
    I swapped it for a better one with the same power delivery and the problem went away


Passing through the audio part of the gpu seems to make it impossible to start the vm

Useful kernel parameters:
- pci=noats # do not use pcie ats (and IOMMU device IOTLB) (dont know if I should set it or not)
- pcie_aspm=off # disable pcie active state power management. Could work to prevent random vm crashes (didn't work)

# Virtiofs
Needed to share linux folder with vm

1. Enable shared memory in memory settings (doesn't conflict with hugepages)
2. Install WinFsp on windows
3. Install virtiofs driver (should be already installed along with all other guest virtio drivers)
4. Set virtiofs service as automatic start in windows

If network is not working, it could be blocked by your firewall. To try set FORWARD chain to accept

**Unrelated**

Resizable bar + above 4GB bla bla is actually good for performance
also it shouldn't have impact on vm config or stability
